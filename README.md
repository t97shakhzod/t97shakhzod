### Hi there 👋

I’m a student at Handong Global University, currently pursuing a degree in ICT Convergence. My primary focus is on the intersection of technology and innovation, and I’m passionate about harnessing the power of digital solutions to solve real-world problems.

🔭 **Current Project:** I’m developing a face recognition-based student attendance monitoring web application. This project aims to streamline attendance tracking, improve accuracy, and enhance the overall classroom experience by leveraging advanced AI and machine learning techniques.

🌱 **Learning and Growth:** As I work on this project, I’m continuously expanding my knowledge in web development, machine learning, and facial recognition technologies. I’m always eager to learn new tools and methodologies that can help me refine my skills and bring innovative ideas to life.

👯 **Collaboration Opportunities:** I’m looking to connect with like-minded individuals and professionals who share my interest in technology-driven solutions. Whether it’s for advice, collaboration, or just to exchange ideas, I’m always open to new opportunities.

💬 **Ask Me About:** If you’re curious about the technologies I’m using, the challenges I’m facing, or just want to chat about the latest trends in ICT, feel free to reach out!

📫 **How to Reach Me:** You can contact me through [your preferred contact method or social media handle].

😄 **Pronouns:** [Mr]

⚡ **Fun Fact:** When I’m not coding or studying, you’ll likely find me exploring the latest tech gadgets or indulging in a good sci-fi novel.
